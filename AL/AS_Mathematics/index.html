        <h3>Chapter 4: Functions and Graphs</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Geometrical Interpretation of Algebraic Solutions</h4>
            <p>In mathematics, algebraic solutions to equations can be visualized geometrically using graphs. The roots of an equation correspond to the points where the graph of the function intersects the x-axis. For example, solving \(f(x) = 0\) geometrically means identifying the x-coordinates of these intersection points. This approach provides an intuitive understanding of solutions and their behavior.</p>
            <h4>Using Intersection Points of Graphs to Solve Equations</h4>
            <p>The intersection points of two functions' graphs, \(y = f(x)\) and \(y = g(x)\), represent the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = g(x)\). At these points, both functions share the same x and y values. Graphing both functions allows for a visual method of identifying solutions, which can be particularly helpful when equations are complex or involve non-linear functions.</p>
            <h4>How to Sketch a Quadratic Function</h4>
            <p>Quadratic functions take the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \). Follow these steps to sketch the graph:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify the Shape</strong>
                    <p>If \( a > 0 \), the parabola opens upwards. If \( a < 0 \), the parabola opens downwards.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Find the Vertex</strong>
                    <p>The vertex is the highest or lowest point of the parabola. Use the formula \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) to find the x-coordinate and substitute it back into the equation to find the y-coordinate.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Determine the Axis of Symmetry</strong>
                    <p>The axis of symmetry is the vertical line \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \), dividing the parabola into two symmetric halves.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Find the Y-Intercept</strong>
                    <p>Set \( x = 0 \) in the equation to find the y-intercept: \( y = c \).</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Find the X-Intercepts (if any)</strong>
                    <p>Solve \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula to find where the parabola crosses the x-axis.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Plot and Sketch</strong>
                    <p>Plot the vertex, y-intercept, and x-intercepts on the graph. Use the axis of symmetry and additional points for accuracy, then draw a smooth curve.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>How to Sketch a Cubic Function</h4>
            <p>Cubic functions take the form \( y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \). Follow these steps to sketch the graph:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify the End Behavior</strong>
                    <p>Determine how the graph behaves as \( x \to \infty \) and \( x \to -\infty \):
                    <ul>
                        <li>If \( a > 0 \), the graph rises to the right and falls to the left.</li>
                        <li>If \( a < 0 \), the graph falls to the right and rises to the left.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Connection to Turning Points</strong>
                    <p>The turning points of a cubic function occur where its derivative equals zero. For \( y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the derivative is:</p>
                    <p>\( y' = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c \).</p>
                    <p>Solving \( y' = 0 \) gives the x-coordinates of the turning points, which depend on \( \Delta = b^2 - 3ac \).</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interpretation of \( \Delta \)(\( b^2 - 3ac\)) </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If \( \Delta > 0 \): The graph has two distinct turning points (one maximum and one minimum), resulting in an "S-shaped" curve.</li>
                        <li>If \( \Delta = 0 \): The graph has one turning point, where the slope flattens but does not change direction. This happens when the curve transitions smoothly without a local maximum or minimum.</li>
                        <li>If \( \Delta < 0 \): The graph has no turning points, and it is monotonic (either always increasing or always decreasing).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Find the Y-Intercept</strong>
                    <p>Set \( x = 0 \) in the equation to find the y-intercept: \( y = d \).</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Find the X-Intercepts (if any)</strong>
                    <p>Solve \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \) to find where the graph crosses the x-axis. Factorization or numerical methods may be needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Find Turning Points</strong>
                    <p>Take the derivative \( y' = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c \) and solve \( y' = 0 \) to find critical points. Use the second derivative to determine if these are maxima, minima, or inflection points.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Plot and Sketch</strong>
                    <p>Plot key points, including intercepts and turning points. Connect them smoothly while respecting the end behavior.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
