    <h2>Mid-Term Information & Revision Tips</h2>
    <h3>Exam Date</h3>
    <p>
        The exam will be held on November 14, 2024.
    </p>
    <h3>Revision Tips</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unit 1: Motion, forces and energy (<a href="./files/Unit1Revision.pdf" target="_blank">Unit 1 Revision Poster</a>)</li>
            <li>Unit 2: Waves(Partly)</li>
        </ul>
        The exam will cover the above mentioned units. I strongly recommend you review the following points:
        <ul>
            <li>Differents between Vector and Scalar</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Differents between Displacement and Distance, Velocity and Speed</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Motion Graph</li>
            <li>Newton's Law of Motion</li>
            <li>⭐️Describe the Process of Free-Fall in the Air</li>
            <li>⭐️Describe Stopping Distance</li>
            <li>Momentum</li>
            <li>Analyize Resultant Force(1D/2D) <a href="/AL/Mathematics/Transformations, Matrices and Vectors/Trigonometry & Vectors.pdf" target="_blank">Check IG Math Vector section to get more information.</a></li>
            <li>⭐️Types of Waves and Differents between them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These points have been discussed in class and are relatively obscure and difficult to understand, or they are easy-to-make mistakes in the last Topic Test.
            <br>In the IG stage, the questions are not mainly focused on the calculation part. There are many descriptive questions in the questions.
            <br>I hope everyone can achieve good results after reviewing these points!
